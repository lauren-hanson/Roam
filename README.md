### Running This Application

#### First, a note about authentication...

This application uses mock authentication which is purely for demonstration purposes. Therefore the login and registration code written here is completely insecure and would never be implemented in a professional application.

#### Now that we've cleared that up...

1. Clone this repository and change to the directory in the terminal.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lauren-hanson/RoamClient
cd RoamClient
```

2. Launch the client.

```sh
    npm install
    npm start
```

3. This will initialize the React app in your browser. Next go [HERE] (https://github.com/lauren-hanson/RoamServer)  and follow the README to gain access to the server.

#### Demo User Credentials

4. Once you are running the server you can log in with these credentials: 

<p>
Username: Roamer<i>demo</i>
<br>
Password: roamer<i>demo</i>
</p>
